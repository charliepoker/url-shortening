### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- AOS (Animation on Scroll)
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt how to use the animation on scroll library

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div  data-aos="fade-right">
<p>This will fade right the div with the AOS class</p>
</div>  
```



### Continued development

I want to focus more on consuming API's with axios
